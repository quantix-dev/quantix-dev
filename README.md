My username is Quantix, but if the former is taken, I will typically go by QuantixDev. I enjoy programming and I always love learning new languages/things about programming. I currently attend college and i'm doing an A-Level in Computer Science.

## About Me
I tend to program and experiment with things, hopefully expanding my knowledge by taking myself out of a comfort zone and learning a new language or a new api. I also typically enjoy playing games with my friends.
